- [ ] Similar study is in the multi-class case
  - continuing

- [x] include rank based result 
  - do now bro.. 
    
- [X] Describe how the precision and recall converges
  - how precision and recall converges, what their differences are and what the implication on intrusion detection sysetm

- [X] why concensus entropy is the best? explain?

- [ ] Do not add the line in the center of different pool based comparison
    - *how to do that* as it is auto generated!!
    
- [ ] different initial points approximately

- [ ] diferent initial points, impact of pecision recall description

- [ ] why did you take 10%, 15%, 20% bla bla, describe how
  - In all the cases based on the probability measure the selected query instances are labeled with opposite of the true label information and the model is taught with that  

- [ ] Wrong labelling impact, which number of instane s are enough for 10%, what happens it increases and comment on precsion recall, for instance 20% wrong labeling, stablisation between 75-100 changes after some query it reaches meaning for stablisation again around 150

- [ ] Did you test the pool size, sir didn't understand that part 

--- 
- [ ] wrong labelling,should i give all strategy results?? 
  - maybe in appendix or what
  

--- 
(i) classification comparison
(ii) different query selection strategy 
(iii) rank based
(iv) impact of different initial seed points
