upto 30 features
- reduce the number of data
7 class


sample data of : 10k data
	- balanced



** what are thire results!!!

for some attack type: resoanbale, for some it's not
	=> as ML: binary classifier
		=> whih classifier perform worst


HY:		=> learning model like fazzer & normal data, and detect fuzzer
				=> exploit and no exploit

9 models(binary) classifier
	-> intermediate step
		-> what causes the problem
	=	SN >
		High Accuuracy > in worms
			=> need sepration
		Worst accuracy <
			create problem

		matrix > fazzer -> worm
			fazzer -> shellcode
			fazzer ->

			fazzer-> reduce data, take 1k


{'Fuzzers', 'Exploits', 'Worms', 'Shellcode', 'Generic', 'Analysis', 'Backdoor', 'DoS', 'Reconnaissance', 'Normal'}







fazzer is 1
all other is 0


8 thousand for one cclass
8 thousand for all


what would be shellcode?


130 of each data, and do the same






->


how low we can go!!




1. multiclass for 1 thousand


2. binary classifier for each


features : 3, 10, 25




cross val score:

scilearn model selection
	=> cross val -> score
		=> accuracy from cross val socre

		do all model is cross validation
		!!

>what does it mean: cross validaiton**
tuesday -> class > entrie understanding of learning
